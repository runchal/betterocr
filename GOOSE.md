# Goose Notes: BetterOCR (Updated)

This document contains a comprehensive analysis of the BetterOCR application, updated as of the end of our last session. It includes a revised overview, detailed file structure, usage instructions, a summary of the testing suite, and UX/UI concepts.

## Application Overview

BetterOCR is a highly sophisticated, two-tiered document processing system. It has evolved from a simple multi-engine OCR script into a powerful, **adaptive learning platform** designed for high-accuracy data extraction.

*   **Basic Implementation:** A simple command-line tool (`betterocr.py`) that demonstrates the core concept of using multiple OCR engines in parallel.
*   **Advanced Implementation (`ocr_engine/`):** A production-ready system with a rich feature set, including:
    *   **Five OCR Engines:** Leverages a diverse set of engines, including modern Transformer-based models (TrOCR, Surya) for maximum accuracy.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from user feedback and past documents to improve its accuracy over time.
    *   **Automatic Document Classification:** Can identify and classify different document types automatically.
    *   **Advanced Data Extraction:** Uses a sophisticated pattern detection system to extract structured data like dates, currency, and key-value pairs.
    *   **Sophisticated Consensus:** Employs multiple strategies to merge the results from the different engines to arrive at the most accurate text.

## File Structure

*   `betterocr.py`: The entry point for the **basic implementation**.
*   `ocr_engine/`: The directory containing the **advanced implementation**.
    *   `src/main_ocr.py`: The main entry point for the advanced system, featuring the `AdaptiveMultiEngineOCR` class.
    *   `src/engines/`: Wrappers for the individual OCR engines.
    *   `src/fusion/`: The sophisticated consensus and data fusion logic.
    *   `src/vision/`: The computer vision and layout analysis modules.
    *   `src/adaptive/`: The components responsible for the system's learning capabilities (pattern detection, classification, feedback processing).
    *   `data/ocr_learning.db`: The SQLite database that stores the system's learned knowledge.
*   `tests/`: A directory containing the unit tests for both the basic and advanced implementations.

## How to Use

### Basic Implementation

```bash
# Process a single document
python betterocr.py samples/your_document.pdf
```

### Advanced Implementation

```bash
# Navigate to the advanced implementation directory
cd ocr_engine

# Run a comprehensive test of the visual validation system
python test_visual_validation.py
```

## Testing

A comprehensive suite of unit tests has been developed to ensure the reliability of the application. The tests are located in the `tests/` directory and are organized as follows:

*   `test_betterocr_basic.py`: Tests for the basic implementation.
*   `test_adaptive_ocr.py`: Tests for the main `AdaptiveMultiEngineOCR` class in the advanced implementation.
*   `test_consensus_merger.py`: Tests for the `ConsensusMerger` component.
*   `test_pattern_detector.py`: Tests for the `PatternDetector` component.

## UX/UI Concepts

The ideal user experience for this application is an **interactive workbench** that fosters a partnership between the user and the AI. Key concepts include:

*   **A Three-Panel Layout:** A document queue, an interactive document viewer, and a structured data validation panel.
*   **Visualized Confidence:** Using color-coded bounding boxes and confidence scores to build user trust and quickly draw attention to potential errors.
*   **Effortless Corrections:** A "click-and-type" editing system that makes it easy for users to correct mistakes and, in doing so, teaches the AI.
*   **Intuitive Document Classification:** Allowing users to easily confirm or change the AI's document classification guess.
*   **A Learning & Analytics Dashboard:** Providing insights into the AI's performance and learning progress over time.

## Next Steps

*   **Complete the Test Suite:** Continue to build out the unit tests for the advanced implementation, focusing on the `DocumentClassifier` and `VisualValidator` components.
*   **Address `CLAUDE.md` Discrepancies:** The `CLAUDE.md` file is significantly out of date. It should be updated or removed to avoid confusion.
*   **Develop a UI Prototype:** Based on the UX/UI concepts we've discussed, the next logical step would be to create a simple front-end prototype to demonstrate the interactive workbench concept.
