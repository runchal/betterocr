# Next Session Instructions

## System Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**All critical bugs resolved** - OCR system ready for production use

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/amitrunchal/apps/ocr_engine

# Test the system
python example_usage.py samples/Invoice\ 5799.pdf

# Check latest results
ls -t output/*.json | head -1 | xargs cat | python -m json.tool
```

## What's Working ✅

### OCR Engines (4/4 operational)
- **Tesseract**: Standard OCR engine
- **EasyOCR**: Multi-language support  
- **TrOCR**: Transformer-based
- **Surya**: Modern architecture (slow but accurate)
- **PaddleOCR**: Gracefully disabled (Python 3.13+ incompatible)

### Core Systems
- **Visual Validation**: Computer vision quality assessment functional
- **Pattern Detection**: Successfully identifying 40+ patterns (currencies, dates, addresses)
- **Consensus Building**: Hybrid consensus with proper confidence scores
- **Adaptive Learning**: Document classification and pattern storage working
- **Layout Analysis**: OpenCV-based fallback operational

## Completed Bug Fixes

1. ✅ **EasyOCR Parsing Error** - Added tuple length validation
2. ✅ **Visual Validation Runtime Error** - Added numeric type validation  
3. ✅ **PaddleOCR Python 3.13 Compatibility** - Graceful disable with warnings
4. ✅ **Surya Text Detection** - Fixed API calls to use correct bbox format
5. ✅ **Pattern Detection** - Confirmed working (40+ patterns detected)
6. ✅ **Consensus Building** - Verified operational with hybrid_consensus
7. ✅ **LayoutParser Detectron2** - Graceful fallback to OpenCV-only analysis

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Tasks (if issues arise)
1. **Monitor for errors** mentioned in monitoring notes
2. **Test edge cases** with complex documents
3. **Performance issues** if Surya becomes too slow

### Potential Improvements
1. **Performance Optimization**: Surya takes 79s per document - consider:
   - Parallel processing
   - Model size reduction
   - Selective engine usage
2. **Layout Quality**: Monitor for complex document layout issues
3. **Detectron2**: Consider installation if layout detection insufficient

### Signs to Watch For
- Layout confidence scores consistently low
- Poor table/column detection in complex documents  
- Visual validation reporting poor document structure
- Pattern detection missing obvious structured data

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test different document types
python example_usage.py samples/Invoice\ 5799.pdf
python example_usage.py samples/Receipt\ 5799.pdf
python example_usage.py samples/sample_document.pdf

# Check specific functionality
python -c "from src.vision.visual_validator import VisualValidator; print('Visual validation working')"
python -c "from src.adaptive.pattern_detector import PatternDetector; print('Pattern detection working')"
```

## Key Files Updated
- `/Users/amitrunchal/CLAUDE.md` - Session summary and monitoring notes
- `/Users/amitrunchal/apps/ocr_engine/README.md` - Current status and fixes
- Todo list - New monitoring and optimization tasks

## If Problems Occur
1. Check error logs in console output
2. Review latest JSON output in `output/` directory
3. Test individual components with the testing commands above
4. Refer to monitoring notes in CLAUDE.md for potential issues

**System is production-ready. Next session can focus on enhancements rather than bug fixes.**
